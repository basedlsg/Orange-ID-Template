# Environment Configuration Example

# SQLite is the default database and requires no configuration
# The setup script will automatically create and initialize the SQLite database
# No environment variables are required for this to work

# Optional: Session Settings (uncomment to set a custom value)
# SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# ======== ADVANCED OPTIONS ========

# For PostgreSQL users (optional, advanced setup)
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database

# Note: 
# - SQLite is used by default and requires no configuration
# - If DATABASE_URL is set, PostgreSQL will be used instead of SQLite

# ==========================================================
# The following are comprehensive prompts you can use with AI assistants:
#
# 1. Basic Setup:
# "I want to set up the Orange Auth Template for my project.
# Initialize the SQLite database, create sample users, and make sure I can log in with the admin account."
#
# 2. Game Application Setup:
# "I want to build a multiplayer snake game using the Orange Auth Template.
# My game should have:
# - A classic snake game with arrow key controls
# - A persistent leaderboard showing top 10 scores
# - Different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
# - Custom snake colors based on user preference
#
# Replace the home screen with the game canvas and menu options.
# Keep the admin dashboard as is and make sure users need to log in before playing.
# Initialize the SQLite database and add fields to store user scores and preferences.
# Add a way for admins to reset scores or ban users who use inappropriate names."
#
# 3. Web Application Setup:
# "I want to build a to-do list application using the Orange Auth Template.
# My app should have:
# - Task creation with title, description, due date, and priority
# - Task categorization with custom categories/tags
# - Task filtering and sorting options
# - Task sharing between users
# - Weekly productivity reports with charts
#
# Initialize the SQLite database, then set up the application.
# Replace the home page with the task dashboard and ensure users must log in to see their tasks.
# Extend the admin dashboard to include system-wide statistics about task completion rates.
# Add the necessary database fields for tasks, categories, and sharing permissions."
