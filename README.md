# OrangeID Authentication Template

A clean, simplified template application with OrangeID authentication and user database storage. It serves as a starting point for developers who want to build applications with pre-configured authentication.

## Features

- **OrangeID Authentication**: Simple login/logout system using Orange ID
- **User Database**: PostgreSQL storage for user information
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist UI with login button and user information display
- **Role-based Authorization**: Support for admin and regular user roles
- **API Endpoints**: Pre-configured endpoints for user creation and admin status checking

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: OrangeID (via Bedrock Passport)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database (the template uses the DATABASE_URL environment variable)
4. Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`
5. Start the application: `npm run dev`

## Authentication Flow

The template uses OrangeID for authentication, which handles the user login process. After a successful login:

1. The user is redirected back to your application
2. User information is stored in the database
3. Authentication state is managed through the BedrockPassport provider

## Database Schema

The template includes a simple user schema with the following fields:

- `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key
- `orangeId`: Unique identifier from OrangeID
- `username`: User's display name
- `email`: User's email address (optional)
- `role`: User role (default: "user")
- `authToken`: Authentication token
- `isAdmin`: Boolean flag for admin privileges
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of account creation

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/users`: Create or update a user
- `GET /api/users/check-admin`: Check if a user has admin privileges

## Customization

This template is designed as a starting point. Here are some ways to customize it:

1. Update the UI in the React components
2. Add additional fields to the user schema
3. Create new API endpoints for your application's needs
4. Implement additional authentication features

## File Structure

- `/client/src`: Frontend React application
- `/server`: Backend Express server
- `/shared/schema.ts`: Database schema definitions
- `/migrations`: Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: (Optional) WalletConnect Project ID for wallet integration
