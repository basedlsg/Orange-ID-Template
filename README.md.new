Replace the home screen with [your main feature] and keep the admin dashboard as is.
Make sure users need to log in before accessing any of the app features.
```

### Complete Example Prompt (Game)

```
I want to build a multiplayer snake game using the Orange Auth Template.

My game should have:
- A classic snake game with arrow key controls
- A persistent leaderboard showing top 10 scores
- Different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Custom snake colors based on user preference

Replace the home screen with the game canvas and menu options.
Keep the admin dashboard as is and make sure users need to log in before playing.
Add fields to store user scores and preferences.
Add a way for admins to reset scores or ban users who use inappropriate names.

Please implement this while maintaining the dark theme with orange accents.
```

### Complete Example Prompt (Web App)

```
I want to build a to-do list application using the Orange Auth Template.

My app should have:
- Task creation with title, description, due date, and priority
- Task categorization with custom categories/tags
- Task filtering and sorting options
- Task sharing between users
- Weekly productivity reports with charts

Replace the home page with the task dashboard and ensure users must log in to see their tasks.
Extend the admin dashboard to include system-wide statistics about task completion rates.
Add the necessary database fields for tasks, categories, and sharing permissions.

Please implement this while maintaining the dark theme with orange accents.

## Detailed Documentation

A clean, simplified template application with OrangeID authentication and user database storage. It serves as a starting point for developers who want to build applications with pre-configured authentication, removing the complexity of implementing an auth system from scratch.

### Features

- **OrangeID Authentication**: Simple login/logout system using Orange ID
- **Session Management**: Secure session-based authentication using express-session
- **User Database**: SQLite database pre-configured and ready to use
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist UI with dark theme and orange accents
- **Role-based Authorization**: Support for admin and regular user roles
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management and analytics for administrators
- **API Endpoints**: Pre-configured endpoints for user creation and admin status checking
- **First-user-is-admin**: First user to log in automatically becomes admin

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- Backend: Express.js with session management
- Database: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: OrangeID (via Bedrock Passport)
- Sessions: express-session with memory storage

## Getting Started

### No Setup Required!

This template is completely pre-configured with SQLite and works for all Replit users (free and paid). Everything is set up and ready to go:

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Click "Run" in Replit to start the application
   - The application will be accessible at the web view URL

2. **Become an Admin**:
   - The first user to log in will automatically become the admin
   - Subsequent users will have regular (non-admin) privileges

### Environment Variables (Optional)

No environment variables are required for the default setup. However, you can customize:

- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for signing session cookies (defaults to a placeholder in development)

## Building Your Application

This template is designed to be a foundation for building your own applications. After setup, you should:

1. **Replace the home page content**: The content in `client/src/pages/home.tsx` can be replaced with your application's main functionality

2. **Extend the user model**: If needed, add additional fields to the user schema in `shared/schema.ts`

3. **Add application-specific pages**: Create new pages in the `client/src/pages` directory and register them in the router in `client/src/App.tsx`

### Example Application Scenarios

#### Quiz Game Example

```
I want to build a multiplayer quiz game using the Orange Auth Template. My game should have:
- A quiz creation form for registered users to create their own quizzes
- A quiz catalog where users can browse and play quizzes created by others
- A leaderboard showing top scorers for each quiz

The application should use the existing authentication system, but replace the home page with the quiz catalog. Only logged-in users should be able to create quizzes or record scores.

I'd like to extend the admin dashboard to include quiz management features where admins can approve, edit, or remove inappropriate content.

Please help me implement this while maintaining the dark theme with orange accents.
```

#### Task Management Example

```
I want to build a team task management app using the Orange Auth Template. My app should have:
- A project dashboard showing all tasks assigned to the user
- Task creation and assignment functionality
- Team management where users can create and invite others to teams
- Task filtering and sorting by priority, due date, and status

The application should use the existing authentication system, replacing the home page with the user's dashboard. I want to extend the user schema to include team memberships.

I'd like to keep the admin dashboard but extend it to include system-wide statistics about task completion rates and team performance.

Please implement this while maintaining the dark theme with orange accents.
```

## Authentication Flow

The template uses OrangeID for authentication, which handles the user login process. After a successful login:

1. The user is redirected back to your application
2. User information is stored in the database
3. A secure session is created to maintain the user's authenticated state
4. Authentication state is managed through the BedrockPassport provider

## Database Schema

The template includes a simple user schema with the following fields:

- `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key
- `orangeId`: Unique identifier from OrangeID
- `username`: User's display name
- `email`: User's email address (optional)
- `role`: User role (default: "user")
- `isAdmin`: Boolean flag for admin privileges
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of account creation

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/users`: Create or update a user
- `GET /api/users/check-admin`: Check if a user has admin privileges
- `GET /api/admin/users`: Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/admin/stats/user-growth`: Get user growth statistics (admin only)

## Admin Dashboard

The template includes a basic admin dashboard with:

- List of all registered users
- Chart showing user growth over time
- Admin-only access protection

## Customization

This template is designed as a starting point. Here are some ways to customize it:

1. Update the UI in the React components
2. Add additional fields to the user schema
3. Create new API endpoints for your application's needs
4. Implement additional authentication features
5. Extend the admin dashboard functionality
